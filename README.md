WOW WAH is a wah-wah filter which emulates the main features of several Wah pedals currently on the market, such as the Boss AW-3.
The key for the acquisition of the Wah effect is the ‘sweeping’ of a pass filter among a frequency range, whose upper and lower limits are defined. 
The characteristic feature of the AW-3 that we reproduced is the switch between two different usage patterns: the tempo and dynamic mode. Together with these two options, WOW WAH has three possible filters (LP, HP and BP), which can be chosen by means of a combo box.
As regards the tempo mode, the WOW WAH interface alllows the user to manually set the rate of sweeping, using a tap tempo button which converts the time interval between two mouse clicks in BPM.

Other adjustable parameters of the WOW WAH are:
- frequency of the Wah
- Q-factor of the filter
- dry/wet
- attack
- decay
- gain
